# MINIMARKET IMPLEMENTATION BLUEPRINT
## Comprehensive Modular Task List for First Implementation

---

## ZERO-RISK GUARANTEE — DO NOT TOUCH CORE INTEGRATIONS

The following integrations are STABLE and FROZEN. Do not modify their code, environment variables, middleware, schemas, webhooks, secrets, or configurations:
- Convex (database, queries, mutations, schema, auth provider)
- Clerk (middleware, providers, webhooks, JWT templates, session handling)
- Stripe (PaymentIntents, webhooks, product/price sync, keys, dashboard settings)

Allowed:
- Consume existing APIs from the frontend and call existing server functions as-is.
- UI/UX work, copy updates, and non-invasive features that do not alter these systems.

Not allowed:
- Any code changes under `convex/`, `middleware.ts` auth wiring, Clerk providers, or payment backend.
- Environment variable updates, webhook secret rotations, or dashboard setting changes.

Scope guards (affects documentation below):
- 1.1.5, 1.3.x, 4.3.x, and 14.1.2–14.1.4 are considered FROZEN. Treat them as reference only unless an emergency rollback is required.
